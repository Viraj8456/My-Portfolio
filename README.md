Technical Portfolio & Systems Logic Projects

This repository contains my foundational web development projects, focusing on translating mathematical logic and system-level debugging experience into functional web interfaces.

🚀 Overview

As an aspiring developer with a background in Physics and professional experience in Trust & Safety at Accenture, I build tools that focus on logic, accuracy, and system efficiency.

🛠 The Projects

1. Physics Logic Engine

A web-based utility designed to translate physical laws into executable JavaScript logic.

Problem: Translating continuous physical formulas into discrete code logic.

Solution: Built a DOM-reactive engine that handles mass/velocity inputs to calculate Kinetic Energy ($KE = ½mv²$).

Key Tech: JavaScript (ES6), Math Object, DOM Manipulation.

2. Dev-Ready Bug Report Tool

Inspired by 5 years of volunteer experience in Android Custom ROM testing (Pixel Experience, Arrow OS).

Problem: Manual bug reporting is often inconsistent and lacks the structure developers need.

Solution: A tool that automates the generation of standardized Markdown reports, including severity levels and reproduction steps.

Key Tech: String manipulation, UI/UX state handling, Clipboard API.

🧬 Why This Matters

I approach Web Development through the lens of First-Principles Thinking. Whether it is analyzing a kernel logcat for a mobile OS or building a responsive UI, I focus on the underlying architecture.

My goal is to bridge the gap between high-level analytical physics and the practical application of modern web technologies.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind), JavaScript

Core Logic: C++, SQL

Cloud: AWS (EC2, IAM, DynamoDB, Sagemaker)
